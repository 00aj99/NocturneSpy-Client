# NocturneSpy - Client

## Note:

I developed this project with the code-maintainability in mind. I'm a web developer and not a mobile developer so what you can see here is the best design I could come up. I'm still trying to improve the code base of this app in my spare time for easy maintainance and to encourage other developers to contribute.
